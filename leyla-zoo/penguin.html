      Penguins are flightless marine birds that live only in the Southern
      Hemisphere. Some can be tracked down in hotter environments, yet most,
      including sovereign, adelie, chinstrap, and gentoo penguins, live in and
      around frosty Antarctica. They range from about 14-45 in. in height and
      2-90 pounds in weight. Most and black and white, color is rare and limited
      to some red or yellow. They mostly eat fish, squid and krill. They live
      approximately 3 to 8 years. A thick layer of fat and firmly pressed, sleek
      quills are great for colder temperatures.

      The 18 unique species of penguins can generally vary in shape and estimate
      however all have dark bodies and white stomaches. This defensive
      countershading permits them to stow away from hunters like panther seals
      and orcas while they swim. While penguins can't fly, their firm flippers,
      webbed feet, and smooth shape make them master swimmers. As a matter of
      fact, they burn through the vast majority of their lives in the sea and do
      virtually all of their chasing after krill, squid, and crabs submerged.
      They can swim around 15 miles 60 minutes, and when they need to speed up,
      they frequently porpoise, or jump out of the water as they swim. Penguins
      are exceptionally friendly animals and their rookeries frequently surpass
      1,000,000 birds! Except for the Emperor penguin, most penguins like to
      gather on sea shores or rocky landscapes. You can frequently smell a
      rookery well before you see one!
