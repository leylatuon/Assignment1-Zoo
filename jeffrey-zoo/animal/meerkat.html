    <h3>The meerkat (Suricata suricatta) or suricate is a small mongoose discovered in southern Africa. It is characterised by its large head, giant eyes, pointed snout, lengthy legs, skinny tapering tail, and a brindled coat pattern. The head-and-body size is round 24â€“35 cm, and the weight is usually between 0.62 and 0.97 kg. The coat is mild gray to yellowish-brown with alternate, mild and darkish bands on the back. Meerkats have foreclaws tailored for digging and have the capability to thermoregulate to live on in their harsh, dry habitat.</h3>
