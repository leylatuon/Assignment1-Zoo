      The bottlenose dolphins are in the genus Tursiops. There are two species of bottlenose dolphins: the common 
      bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus).
      They marine mammals and must surface to breathe air and give birth. They eat fish, squid, and shrimp and they inhabit 
      warm and temperate seas. They also have a lifespan from 45 to 50 years.
