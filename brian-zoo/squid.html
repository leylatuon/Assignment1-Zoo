      The squid is a cephalopod in the cephalopoda class. Squids have an elongated soft body, large eyes, eight arms, 
      and two tentacles. The tentacles are used to grab their prey, and the arms are to hold and control it. Squids also have a 
      beak to cut their prey into smaller pieces to swallow. They are also capable of changing color for camouflage and signalling 
      and some spcies are bioluminescent.
