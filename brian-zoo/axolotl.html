    <p>The axolotl is an amphibian that was originally found in several lakes around Mexico. 
      Their habitats are freshwater lakes and eat small prey like mollusk, worms, other arthropods and small fish. A fun fact is that axolotls have amazing healing capabilities, 
      where they can fully regrow a limb.</p>
