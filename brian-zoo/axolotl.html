      The axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) is an amphibian that was originally found in several lakes around Mexico. 
      Their habitats are freshwater lakes and eat small prey like mollusk, worms, other arthropods and small fish. 
      A fun fact is that axolotls have amazing healing capabilities, where they can fully regrow a limb. 
      Axolotl are also considered "critically endangered."
